## Small Variance Normal Prior (SVNP): a better Solution for a Complicated Issue 

  + Don't just assume that cross-loadings are zero ( $\mathcal{N}(0, 0)$ )
  + Instead make a more realistic and flexible assumption [@muthen_bayesian_2012]:
    - Small Variance Prior, e.g.: $\mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)$ 
    - allowing for a more flexible model identification and model selection

## Small Variance Normal Prior (SVNP): Still no ideal Solution for a Complicated Issue

- Also (relevant) cross-loadings far from zero are shrunken [@lu_bayesian_2016] 

- Consequently other parameters in the model (e.g. the factor-correlation, main-loadings) end up substantially biased too

- As solution, a two-step procedure is required, which is cumbersome and introduces a number of researchers degrees of freedom
  
*&#8594;* More advanced priors need to be identified that can outperform the small-variance prior *in a single step*

## The present study

- Population conditions:
  - N: 100, 200
  - magnitude cross-loading: 0.2, 0.5
- Prior conditions:
  - $\sigma^2$: 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 [@muthen_bayesian_2012]
- Sampling parameters:
  -  burnin 2000, chain length 4000 
- 200 iterations per individual set of conditions
- Main outcomes: (mean absolute) bias, MSE, Power, Type I error rate
  - different selection rules regarding the latter two: tresholds, credible intervals [@zhang_criteria_2021]

## Preliminary Results: How does the SVNP perform 

## Foreshadowing Thesis

- same population conditions as above
