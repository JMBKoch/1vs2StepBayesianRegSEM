## The art of Statistical Modeling

[](datagenVsModel.png)

## Fundamental Trade-off in Statistical Modeling 

## Simple Structure: a poor Solution for a Complicated Issue

## Small Variance Normal Prior (SVNP): a better Solution for a Complicated Issue 

## Bayesian SEM: still no ideal Solution for a Complicated Issue

## Promising Alternative: The Regularized Horseshoe Prior

## Preliminary Results: How does the SVNP perform
