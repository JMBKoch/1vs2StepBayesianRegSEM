# Abstract

This was the first study to compare the Regularized Horseshoe Prior (RHSP) to the Small Variance Normal Prior (SVNP) in their performance in regularizing cross-loadings in Bayesian CFA. The SVNP can be used to shrink cross-loadings in CFA to(wards) zero to identify models. This often results in biased model estimates, as also large cross-loadings are shrunken substantially. The RHSP was expected to regularize cross-loadings more efficiently, avoiding the bias of the SVNP, by allowing large cross-loadings to escape shrinkage within a single estimation step. It was found that, as expected, the SVNP had overall higher levels of bias than the RHSP under the presence of large cross-loadings. Hereby, the RHSP was robust across sample sizes, and different hyper-parameter settings, although under some convergence failed. Regarding the Power and Type-I-Error rate in selecting cross-loadings as non-zero, both priors performed poorly, which is partially explained by the low sample sizes considered.

# Introduction

The art of statistical modeling revolves around coming up with an appropriate simplification, a  *model*, of a true *data-generating process*. Hereby, a fundamental trade-off between model simplicity and model complexity arises, that is mostly known as *bias-variance trade-off*. Simple models with few parameters have high bias, meaning that they deviate substantially from the true data-generating process, and low variance, such that they generalize well to other datasets from the same population. Complex models with large numbers of parameters tend to have low bias and high variance. They are thus prone to over-fitting, i.e. picking up patterns that are only relevant in the dataset at hand, but do not generalize well to other datasets. Moreover, complex models can be cumbersome to interpret and often a large number of observations is required to estimate them [@cox_principles_2006; @james_introduction_2021]. 

In confirmatory factor analysis [CFA, @bollen_structural_1989] it is common practice to deal with the bias-variance trade-off in a brute-force manner, by imposing a so-called simple structure. Here, cross-loadings, factor loadings that relate items to factors that they
theoretically do not belong to, are fixed to zero to yield an identified and easy-to-interpret model. This often leads to poor model fit, which forces researchers to free some cross-loadings after the fact based on empirical grounds (modification indices) to improve fit. This procedure is flawed, as it risks capitalization on chance and thereby over-fitting [@maccallum_model_1992]. As a Bayesian solution to this issue @muthen_bayesian_2012 proposed  identifying CFA models, by setting the so-called *Small Variance Normal Prior* (SVNP) for them which is a normal distribution with mean zero and a very small variance (e.g. $\sigma^2$ = 0.01). This prior has a large peak at zero, and very thin tails. Hence, it attaches large prior mass to cross-loadings of or near zero, while attaching almost no prior mass to cross-loadings further from zero. Consequently, in the Bayesian model estimation that combines the data and the prior, all cross-loadings in the model are shrunken. The larger the priorâ€™s variance, the more admissive the model is in the amount of deviation from zero it allows. 

An issue with @muthen_bayesian_2012's Bayesian CFA is that not only the cross-loadings close to zero, which are considered irrelevant, are shrunken to zero, as desired. Also the ones further from zero are shrunken heavily towards zero, which introduces bias [@lu_bayesian_2016]. First, bias naturally occurs in the large cross-loadings itself. However, also in other parameters, such as factor-correlations or main-loadings, substantial bias can arise, as they are estimated conditionally on the cross-loadings. Consequently, Bayesian CFA requires two steps in practice. First, the model is estimated with the SVNP set for the cross-loadings. Cross-loadings are then selected as non-zero when their 95% credible intervals does not contain zero [@muthen_bayesian_2012]. The model is then re-estimated, where cross-loadings that have been selected to be non-zero are freely estimated without shrinkage, and the remaining cross-loadings are fixed to zero, avoiding the bias in the model of the previous step. Correctly selecting cross-loadings as non-zero can pose a challenge in practice, as the performance of different selection criteria depends on a broad set of conditions, making it difficult to formulate general recommendations for researchers [@zhang_criteria_2021]. It is thus desirable to identify shrinkage-priors that can regularize CFA models without causing substantial bias, within a single step.

One promising regularization-prior that can be expected to estimate CA models with less bias within a single step is the so-called Regularized Horseshoe Prior (RHSP). While the Regularized Horseshoe Prior has been shown to perform excellently in the selection of relevant predictors in regression [@piironen_sparsity_2017; @van_erp_shrinkage_2019], no previous research has validated its performance in regularizing cross-loadings in CFA. We therefore aim to compare the RHSP to the SVNP in their performance in regularizing cross-loadings in Bayesian CFA. 


## Regularization 

A classic method of trying to find a balance between model complexity and model simplicity is *regularization* [@hastie_statistical_2015]. Regularization entails adding some bias to a model on purpose to reduce its variance. This helps to make models easier to interpret and more generalizable. In a frequentist context, regularization is achieved by adding a penality term to the cost function of a model. This ensures that model parameters that are irrelevant, e.g. small regression coefficients in a regression model with a large number of predictors, are shrunken to (or towards) zero. For a regression model:
$$y_i = \beta \mathbf{x_i} + e_i, \ where $$
$$e_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$
the Ordinary Least Squared Residuals estimates of $\beta$ are obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals:
$$ \hat{\beta} = \underset{\beta}{argmin} \{ \Sigma_{i=1}^N(y_i - \beta\mathbf{x_{i}} )^2 \}.$$ Penalized regression adds a a penalty term to this cost function, which is generally denoted as $||\beta||_L$:
$$ \hat{\beta} = \underset{\beta}{argmin} \{ \Sigma_{i=1}^N(y_i - \beta \mathbf{x_{i}} )^2 + \lambda ||\beta||_{L} \}.$$ 
When L = 1, the so-called L-1 norm, $||\beta||_1 = \Sigma_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|$, the well-known LASSO penality [@tibshirani_regression_1996; @tibshirani_regression_2011]. When, L = 2, the L2-norm, $||\beta||_2 = \sqrt{\Sigma_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2}$. This is the famous ridge penalty [@hoerl_ridge_2000]. The so-called tuning-parameter $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter that is in practice often determined through cross-validation. The larger $\lambda$, the higher the penality, and the more will estimates of $\beta_j$ be shrunken to(wards) zero. One disadvantage of the frequentest regularization approach is that it depends on optimization. With more complicated penalties, especially, for complex models can become hard to optimize in practice when more complex, it can be hard to derive optimization cost functions in practice. Also the derivation of unbiased standard errors is often challanging under these circumstances, which hinders infernce [jacobucci_regularized_2016; @jacobucci_comparison_2018]


In a Bayesian context (> meteen met voordelen beginnen) [zie ook @jacobucci_comparison_2018] instead of adding a penalty to the cost function of a model, so-called shrinkage-priors are set for parameters [see @van_erp_shrinkage_2019 for an overview]. In Bayesian model estimation, the so-called Joint Posterior Distribution of the model-parameters given the data $P({\theta} | data)$ is a combination of the data and the prior. Priors can not only be set to steer model estimates towards expected outcomes, for instance based on previous research. Also shrinking model parameters to(wards) zero can be achieved by setting priors that, in general, attach a lot of prior mass to the parameter in question being zero. In the most simple case one can simply set a normal prior for regression coefficients that is centered around zero, which resembles the ridge-penalty [@hsiang_bayesian_1975]. The lasso penalty can be mimicked by setting a Laplace- (double exponential) prior for the regression coefficients [@park_bayesian_2008; @hans_bayesian_2009; see @van_erp_shrinkage_2019 for the Bayesian equivalents of other relevant penalties]. In general, an advantage of Bayesian Regularization over the frequentist approach is that it does not rely on optimization, since the the model estimation is achieved through MCMC methods. This allows for more flexibility in regularization, as shrinkage priors are not limited by having to lead to an optimizable cost function together with the model, as is the case with frequentist penalties. 

Regularization can also be applied outside of regression, for instance in Structural Equation Modeling [SEM,  @jacobucci_regularized_2016]. Regularized SEM entails adding penalties to the cost function of SEM models (typically a variant of the maximum likelihood cost function) to reach sparser models.

## Bayesian CFA: The Small Variance Normal Prior (SVNP)

Confirmatory Factor Analysis [CFA, @bollen_structural_1989] is an essential tool for modeling measurement structures, falling under the class of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). For every individual i, the scores on a vector of p observed indicators $\mathbf{y}_i$ (typically items of a psychological test):
$$\boldsymbol{y}_i = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \Lambda \boldsymbol{\eta}_i + \boldsymbol{e}_i ,$$
where $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of observed indicators, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of intercepts, $\Lambda$ is a $p \times q$ matrix of factor loadings, $\boldsymbol{\eta}_i$ is a $q \times 1$ vector of scores on the latent factors, and $\boldsymbol{e}_i$ is a $p \times 1$ is a random vector of random (measurement) error terms. Here, $\Lambda$ is thus the part of the equation that relates the latent variables to the observed scores on the items. We can differentiate between so-called main-loadings, and cross-loadings. The former are factor loadings that relate factor and items to one another that are theoretically expected to have a relationship. Cross-loadings are factor loadings that relate factors to items between which, theoretically, no relationship should exist. 

In CFA it is common practice to deal with the bias-variance trade-off in a brute-force manner, by imposing a so-called simple structure. While generally, the model allows for *some* cross-loadings to not be fixed to zero, this practice entails fixing all cross-loadings to zero to yield an identified and interpretable model. This often leads to poor model fit, which forces researchers to free some cross-loadings after the fact based on empirical grounds (modification indices) to improve fit. This procedure is flawed, as it risks capitalization on chance and thereby over-fitting [@maccallum_model_1992].

As solution to the issue @muthen_bayesian_2012 proposed *Bayesian CFA*, an alternative, more flexible approach for identifying CFA models, which can be viewed as a form of regularized SEM. 

## The Spike and Slab Prior

One suitable regularization prior for the purpose of selecting cross-loadings in
regularized Bayesian SEM is the so-called Spike-and-Slab Prior [@george_variable_1993; @ishwaran_spike_2005; @mitchell_bayesian_1988]. This prior is a discrete mixture of an extremely peaked prior around zero (the spike), and a very flat prior for larger parameters (the slab). Formally, and applied to the cross-loadings in CFA, for every Cross-loading of factor j
on item k, the Spike-and-Slab Prior can be specified as (Lu et al., 2016):
$$\lambda_{c,jk} |r_{jk} \sim (1 \ - \ r_{jk})\delta_0 + r_{jk} \mathcal{N}(0, c^2_{jk}) , \ with$$
$$r_{jk} \sim \mathcal{Bernoulli}(p_{jk}).$$
The basic intuition is as follows. When $r_{jk} = 1$, $\lambda_{c,jk} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, c^2_{jk})$, hence $\lambda_{c,jk}$ is assigned to the slab. When $r_{jk} = 0$, $\lambda_{c,jk} \sim \delta_0$, and is thus assigned to the spike. This ensures that large cross-loadings, that are are relevant are not shrunken while small, negligible cross-loadings are shrunken to zero. 

Lu et al. (2016) found that this prior is performing well in shrinking truly zero cross-loadings to zero, while not shrinking (relevant) large cross-loadings to avoid bias, especially under favorable conditions with large sample sizes and cross-loadings. However, the Spike and Slab Prior cannot be implemented in STAN, one of the most popular package for MCMC-sampling, as STAN does not allow for discrete mixture priors [@stan_development_team_stan_2021; @betancourt_conceptual_2018]. This calls for a *non-discrete* alternative shrinkage-prior that also outperforms the SVNP within a single estimation step. 

## The Regularized Horseshoe Prior (RHSP)

A fully continuous alternative to the Spike and Slab prior that is implementable in STAN is the so-called *Regularized Horseshoe Prior* [RHSP, @piironen_hyperprior_2017; @piironen_sparsity_2017]. This prior is an extension of the Horseshoe Prior [@carvalho_horseshoe_2010]. The main idea of the original Horseshoe Prior is that there is a *global shrinkage parameter* $\tau$, shrinking all cross-loadings to zero. Next to this, there is a *local shrinkage parameter* $\bar{\omega}_{jk}$^[We deviate from the common notation of the local shrinkage parameter as $\bar{\lambda}$, as this letter is commonly used to denote factor loadings in CFA.] that allows truly large cross-loadings to escape the shrinkage, by setting thick Cauchy tails for the local scales $\omega_{jk}$ [@polson_shrink_2010]. Formally, the Horseshoe prior for every cross-loading of factor j on item k is specified as follows:
$$\lambda_{c,jk} | \omega_{jk}, \tau, c\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \ \omega^2_{jk} \tau^2), \ where$$
$$\omega_{jk} \sim \mathcal{C^+}(0, 1).$$

The name-giving intuition behind the horseshoe prior becomes clear when considering the finding that a so-called shrinkage factor  $k_{jk}$  can be derived for the individual cross-loadings [@carvalho_horseshoe_2010; @piironen_sparsity_2017]. This shrinkage factor ranges from zero to one, with zero meaning no, and one meaning a lot of shrinkage. When plotting the density of $k_{jk}$ there is a very high peak at at very low values and a very high peak of high values, resulting in a plot that resembles a horseshoe, illustrating that the Horseshoe Prior has the desired property of either shrinking parameters very little, or very much, with very few parameters that are shrunken in a non-extreme fashion.

The Horseshoe Prior was found consistently to possess the theoretical properties of shrinking not shrinking large parameters while shrinking small parameters substantially to zero, in practice [@carvalho_horseshoe_2010; @polson_shrink_2010; @datta_asymptotic_2013; @van_der_pas_horseshoe_2014]. However, due to its Cauchy tails it suffers from the same issues as a Cauchy prior. Specifically, not shrinking large parameters at all can lead to estimation issues, especially when parameters are weakly identified. This happens for instance in logistic regression with separable data, where a flat likelihood and thereby a weakly identified model arises [@ghosh_use_2018]. The RHSP prevents such issues by shrinking also large parameters a little bit. For every cross-loading of factor j on item k:
$$\lambda_{c,jk} | \bar{\omega}_{jk}, \tau, c\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \ \bar{\omega}^2_{jk} \tau^2), \ with \ \bar{\omega}^2_{jk} = \frac{c^2\omega_{jk}^2}{c^2 + \tau^2 \omega_{jk}^2},$$
$$\tau | df_{global}, s_{global} \sim half-t_{df_{global}}(0,\  s_{global}^2), \ with \  s_{global} = \frac{p_0}{p-p_0}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}},$$
$$\omega_{jk}| df_{local}, s_{local} \sim half-t_{df_{local}}(0, \ s_{local}^2),$$
$$c^2 | df_{slab}, s_{slab} \sim \mathcal{IG}(\frac{df_{slab}}{2}, \  df_{slab} \times \frac{s_{slab}^2}{2}),$$
where $p_0$ represents a prior guess of the number of relevant cross-loadings. It is not necessary to use $p_0$. One can simply set $s_{global}$ manually, whereby it is worth to consider that a $s_{global}$ created based on a $p_0$ will typically be much lower than 1 [@piironen_sparsity_2017]. Note that we specify the RHSP in its most general form. Setting the degrees of freedoms of the half-t-distributions to 1 results in half-Cauchy distributions. Strictly speaking, the prior is only a Regularized *Horseshoe* Prior when this is the case. In the current study we vary the degrees of freedoms of all scale parameters to assess the extent to which the sparcifying properties as well as the convergence of the RHSP are influenced by these parameters. 

The intuition of how the RHSP shrinks large parameters a little bit is best illustrated by assuming that c is a given constant. Now, when $\tau^2 \omega^2_{jk} < c^2$, $\bar{\omega}^2_{jk} \to \omega^2_{jk}$. Hence, in this case the RHSP approaches the original Horseshoe Prior, with equally pronounced shrinkage to zero. In the limit, the product of $\tau^2$ and $\omega^2_{jk}$ will be smaller under small cross-loadings. Datasets coming from a population with a true small cross-loading should, on average, possess the property of steering the posterior estimates towards small values of the local shrinkage factor, which allows these parameters to escape the shrinkage. However, when $\tau$ is far from zero, hence under large true cross-loadings, $\tau^2 \omega^2_{jk} > c^2$, and  $\bar{\omega}^2_{jk} \to \frac{c^2}{\tau^2}$. Then, the prior of $\lambda_{c,jk}$ approaches a slab $\mathcal{N}(0, c^2)$. Under the above specification, when c is no constant but a parameter for which an Inverse-Gamma hyper-prior is set, the slab becomes a t-distribution with $df_{slab}$ degrees of freedom, a mean of zero and a scale of $scale_{slab}^2$ [@piironen_sparsity_2017].

Figure 1 compares the two shrinkage-priors that are the focus of our study. Both priors share a large peak at zero, which ensures that cross-loadings are shrunken to(wards) zero. However, the RHSP has much thicker tails. Here, for larger cross-loadings, there is thus much more prior mass than with the SVNP. This ensures large cross-loadings (and consequently other model parameters) can be estimated without bias within a single estimation step. 

# The current study 

## Study Procedure and Parameters

A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted using STAN [@stan_development_team_stan_2021] and R [@r_core_team_r_2021]. All code that was used to run the simulations can be openly accessed on the author's [**github**](https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM)^[Specifically, the R-scripts needed to run the simulation can be found on https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/tree/main/R. `parameters.R` can be adjusted to adjust study parameters, and `main.R` is used to run the main simulation. Required packages are listed at the top of `parameters.R`.]. The models were sampled using the No-U-Turn-Sampler [@homan_no-u-turn_2014], with two chains, a burnin-period of 2000 and a chain-length of 4000. These sampling parameters were identified in pilot runs to be required for the RHSP to reach convergence, and were therefore also used for the SVNP in order to ensure a fair comparison. 

## Conditions 

### Population Conditions

The datasets were simulated based on a true 2-factor model, with three items per factor, and a factor correlation of 0.5. The true model is summarized below, both in equations (Appendix A) and graphically (Figure 2).^[The stan code of the model can be found on https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/blob/main/stan/SVNP.stan.] The factors were scaled by fixing their means to zero and their variances to 1. All main-loadings were set to 0.75, and all residual variances to 0.3, to ensure that the largest proportion of variance in the items would be explained by their corresponding factor. We varied the size of the two truly non-zero cross-loadings $\lambda_{c 5}$ and $\lambda_{c 6}$ between 0.2, a negligible magnitude such that shrinkage to zero is desired, and 0.5, a size for which shrinkage towards zero should be avoided. We varied the sample sizes of the simulated datasets between 100 and 200. Larger sample sizes of for instance 500 were not included despite being common place in the literature, because adding them would have rendered the run-time of the simulations for the RHSP unfeasible. This is appropriate because for simple factor models researchers are unlikely to collect such larger sample sizes in practice. 

### SVNP: Prior Conditions 

We varied the hyper-parameter of the SVNP $\sigma^2$ between 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1, based on @muthen_bayesian_2012. For the SVNP this left us with a total number of 2 x 2 x 3 = 12 individual sets of conditions. Per set of conditions, 200 replications were run, yielding a total of 2400 replications for this prior. 

### RHSP: Prior Conditions 

The RHSP has six hyper-parameters in the specification that we apply. We varied the scales of the global shrinkage parameter $\tau$, $s_{global}$ between, 0.1 and 1. Here 1, is a natural maximum given that the scale are generally not larger than 1 when applying a prior guess $p_0$ [@piironen_sparsity_2017], and 0.1 a logical minimum given the scale of the model. Also the scale of the local shrinkage parameter $\omega_{jk}$ was varied between, 0.1 and 1. The degrees of freedoms of these two parameters, $df_{local}$ and $df_{global}$ were varied between 1 and 3. For the local shrinkage parameter, larger degrees of freedoms may help to overcome sampling issues that can arise when $df_{local} = 1$, i.e. when the prior reduces to a half-Cauchy prior.  Finally, for the scale of the distribution of $c^2$, $scale_{slab}$ was varied between 0.1, 1 and 5, and $df_{slab}$ between 1 and 3. We decided to include a broader range scales for the slab, as it is the most central hyper-parameter of the RHSP in determining the shrinkage of large cross-loadings. This left a total of 96 individual hyper-parameter conditions for the RHSP. In combination with the 2x2 population conditions we were left with 384 individual sets of conditions for this prior. In total there were thus $384 \times 200 = 76800$ replications run for this prior.

## Outcomes

All outcomes^[Summaries of all outcomes can be found on https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/tree/main/Rmd/plots.] were computed based on both mean and median posterior estimates of the model parameters. We only present the results of the mean estimates, but those concerning the median estimates (which do not differ relevantly from those of the mean estimates) can be accessed on github^[see TBA LINK for the SVNP and TBA LINK for the RHSP]. 

### Mean Absolute Bias

For every model parameter $\theta$ and for every set of conditions that has been sampled from for $N_{rep}$ replications, we computed the Mean Absolute Bias:
$$\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\theta}} = \frac{1}{N_{rep}} \Sigma_{i = 1}^{N_{rep}} |\bar{\theta_i} - \theta_{true}|.$$ 
Given that the core issue of the SVNP is biased model estimates, this outcome naturally plays a central role in our study.

### Relative Bias

The (Mean) Relative Bias was computed per model parameter estimate and set of conditions by dividing the estimates of the Mean Absolute Bias by the true value of the parameter:
$$\bar{Bias}_{rel, \ \bar{\theta} } = \frac{\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\theta}}}{\theta_{true} }.$$
This outcome gives an indication of the magnitude of the bias by expressing it relative to the parameter's true value. However, given the standardized scale of the true model, the Mean Absolute Bias is a quantity that can be interpreted rather intuitively in the context of this study. We therefore do not discuss these results in detail, and refer the interested reader to the study repository on github^[see TBA LINK for the relative bias of the SVNP and TBA LINK for the relative bias of the RHSP].

### Mean Squared Error:

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was computed per model parameter and set of conditions as:
$$MSE_{\bar{\theta}} = \frac{1}{N_{rep}} \Sigma_{i = 1}^{N_{rep}} (\bar{\theta_i} - \theta_{true})^2.$$
Another way to express the MSE is as the sum of the bias and the variance of a model parameter, which explains its added value over the Mean Absolute Bias alone. As with the Relative Bias we refrain from presenting results here as they do not add to the conclusions based on the Mean Absolute Bias^[MSE estimates and plots can be found on TBA Link for the SVNP and TBA LINK for the RHSP]. 

### Power and Type-I-Error Rate

We computed the Mean Power (true positive rate) per set of conditions in selecting truly non-zero cross-loadings as non-zero by calculating the proportion of replications where the truly non-zero cross-loadings were selected as non-zero, and averaging this over the 2 truly non-zero cross-loadings. 

The Mean Type-I-Error (false positive) rate in selecting truly zero cross-loadings as non-zero, was computed as the proportion of truly zero cross-loadings selected as non-zero, averaged over the four truly zero cross-loadings. 

For both of these outcomes, we applied a variety of selection criteria for selecting cross-loadings as non-zero, based on @zhang_criteria_2021. First, we used a variety of thresholding rules, where a cross-loading is selected as non-zero when the absolute value of its estimate exceeds a specific threshold: 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15. Next, we we considered four credible intervals (50%, 80%, 90%, 95%), where cross-loadings are selected as non-zero when the interval does not contain zero. 

# Results

## Convergence

### SVNP
In terms of convergence, the SVNP showed excellent performance. Across all 2400 replications there was no single parameter for which $\hat{R} > 1.05$. Across all parameters, the minimum value of the Effective Sample Size $N_{eff}$ was 39.4% of the chain length. For the largest majority of runs $N_{eff}$ even exceeded 50% of the chain length. Moreover, across all runs there was not a single divergent transition. All 2400 replications were therefore included in the results.

### RHSP

The RHSP showed weaker performance in terms of convergence than the SVNP, although with most hyper-parameter configurations it was still acceptable, especially conisdering the very complex nature of the underlying model. 

A total of 156 replications failed entirely. They all happend under  one set of conditions: N = 100, size $\lambda_{c1,6} = 0.2, N = 100, scale_{global} = scale_{local} = scale_{slab} = 0.1, df_{global} = df_{local} = df_{slab} = 1$. This likely happened due to identification issues. We removed the remaining 44 replications under this set of conditions, as they were too little to give a reliable picture. 

Next, we removed all replications in which at least one model parameter had a value of $\hat{R} >= 1.05$, or a value for $N_{eff}$ smaller than 10% of the chain-length. This removed a total of 542 replications. The maximum number of removed replications for a given set of conditions was 37, which corresponds to 18.5% of the of replications under these conditions. Below in Table 1 we present all combinations of conditions under which more than 5% of the replications had to be removed. 

```{r}
rowsRemovedLarger5Perc <- readr::read_rds("~/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/Rmd/figures/rowsRemovedLarger5Perc.Rds")
papaja::apa_table(rowsRemovedLarger5Perc, escape = F, 
                  caption = "Conditions under which more than 5\\% of replications were removed due to not reaching convergence (N = 542).",
                  note = "Replications were removed for having an $\\hat{R} >= 1.05$ or an $N_{eff}$  smaller that 10\\% of the chain-length, for any of the model parameters.")
```

Table 2 presents all sets of conditions under which there were, on average, at least 5% divergent transitions per chain. We decided not to remove such replications, as this would have remove a substantial number of 4474 replications. In general, it is advised not to included any divergent transitions, since they introduce bias. Given the complex nature of the RHSP it is hard to follow this advise in practice. However, it needs to be  taken into  account in the interpretation of the findings that the divergent transions may have added bias to the model estimates of the RHSP. 

```{r}
meanPropDIVlarger5 <- readr::read_rds("~/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/Rmd/figures/meanPropDIVlarger5.Rds")
papaja::apa_table(meanPropDIVlarger5, escape = F, 
                  caption = "Conditions with on average more than 5\\% divergent transitions.", note =  "There was a total of 4474 replications were the divergent transitions exceeded 5\\% of the chain-length. There were 19036 replications with more than 1\\% of divergent transitions. There were 1970 replications with more than 10\\% of divergent transitions. There were 186 replications with more than 50\\% of divergent transitions.")

## Main Results

### Mean Absolute Bias: SVNP

The Mean Absolute Bias of the SVNP for all parameters is summarized in Figure 3. For parameter estimates that show an identical pattern ($\bar{\lambda}_{c 2-5}$, $\bar{\lambda}_{c 1, 6}$, $\bar{\lambda}_{m 1, 2, 5, 6}$, $\bar{\lambda}_{m 3-4}$, and $\bar{\theta}_{1-6}$), the first respecting estimate is presented representative for all, both in Figure 3 and in the numbers presented below. As results are almost identical for the two sample sizes, we focus on presenting the findings for N = 100, to not distract from our main conclusions.^[The Mean Absolute Bias of the SVNP visualized for the different sample sizes separately can be found on https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/blob/main/Rmd/plots/plotsBiasSVNP.html.]

Figure 3 shows that, as expected, there was substantial bias in some parameter estimates. While the bias in the posterior means of the truly zero cross-loadings $\bar{\lambda}_{c 2-5}$ was relatively small, it was pronounced in the estimates of the truly non-zero cross-loadings $\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}$ and $\bar{\lambda}_{c 6}$. Particularly with a large true cross-loading of 0.5 and $\sigma^2 = 0.001$ the bias was very large, e.g. $\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}} = 0.49$, since the estimates of the true cross-loadings of 0.5 were shrunken almost entirely to zero (e.g. $\bar{\lambda}_{c 1} = 0.01$). The choice of $\sigma^2$ played a crucial role here. Also with $\sigma^2 =  0.01$ (and true cross-loadings of 0.5) substantial bias occured (e.g. $\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}} = 0.35$), as the cross-loading were still under-estimated considerably ($\bar{\lambda}_{c 1} = 0.15$), though not entirely shrunken to zero. With $\sigma^2 = 0.1$ the bias in the estimates of the cross-loadings was less pronounced (e.g. $\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}} = 0.14$). Here $\sigma^2$ was large enough to estimate the cross-loadings closer to their true value, $\bar{\lambda}_{c 1} = 0.37$.

Also the estimates of the main loadings of factor 1 on item 3 ($\bar{\lambda}_{m 3}$) and of factor 2 on item 4 ($\bar{\lambda}_{m 4}$) were substantially biased when the true cross-loadings were 0.5 and $\sigma^2 = 0.001$ (e.g. $\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\lambda}_{m 3}} = 0.40$). These two loadings showed much higher bias than the other four main-loadings as they loaded on the same two items as the two non-zero cross-loadings ($\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}$ and $\bar{\lambda}_{c 6}$, see Figure 2). As the cross-loadings were shrunken to zero, these main loadings now also had to account for the variance in the items that was truly explained by the cross-loadings. Consequently, the two main-loadings were over-estimated, e.g. $\bar{\lambda}_{m 3} = 1.15$. 

In the factor correlation the bias was also relatively small and approximately the same for the different values of $\sigma^2$ when the truly non-zero cross-loadings were 0.2. Again, bias became much more pronounced with true cross-loadings of 0.5, especially when $\sigma^2 = 0.001$ ($\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\Psi}_{1,2}} = 0.34$). In this situation the factor correlation was heavily over-estimated ($\bar{\Psi}_{1,2} = 0.84$). This was because the covariance between item 3 and 4 that arose from the two cross-loadings, was mis-attributed to the factor-correlation, as the cross-loadings were shrunken to zero.

The bias in the estimates of the residual variances $\bar{\theta}_{1-6}$ was not large across different conditions, although also here a noticeable increase occurs between true cross-loadings of 0.2 and 0.5 when $\sigma^2 = 0.001$.

### Mean Absolute Bias: RHSP

Figure 3 illustrates the Mean Absolute Bias of the RHSP for N = 100 and all hyper-parameters of the RHSP set to one. We compared the Mean Absolute Bias between different hyper-parameter settings and sample sizes^[see https://github.com/JMBKoch/1vs2StepBayesianRegSEM/blob/main/Rmd/analyses/RHSP/plotsBiasRHSP.html]. Differences were so little that we do not present them here, to not distract from our main comparison  to the SVNP. We thus argue that in terms of bias, the RHSP showed to be robust to different hyper-parameter settings. We decided to present the findings with all hyper-parameters set to one, as this is a logical default hyper-parameter configuration under the scale of a standardized CFA model. 

In general, the RHSP showed very similar patterns to the SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.01$, and thus much less bias than the SVNP under most hyper-parameter settings. For the truly zero cross-loadings, the bias was relatively little, although here it was actually slightly larger than for the SVNP with

For the truly zero cross-loadings $\bar{\lambda}_{c 2-5}$, the bias was lower than for the SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.01, 0.01$ when the true cross-loadings were 0.2. Most importantly bias was substantially lower than that of the with $\sigma^2 = 0.01, 0.01$ under  under true cross-loadings of 0.5 (TBA EST). For the truly non-zero cross-loadings $\bar{\lambda}_{c 1, 6}$ the bias also resembled that of the SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. Most importantly, under true cross-loadings of 0.5, it was substantially lower than that of the  SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.01, 0.01$ (e.g. $\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\lambda}_{c 1}} = 0.14$). Here, the the RHSP allowed the large cross-loadings to mostly escape the shrinkage ($bar{\lambda}_{c 1}$ = 0.37), although there was still some shrinkage present. 

Also with regard to main-loadings the RHSP performed strikingly similar to the SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. 

For the factor correlation, the RHSP had the least amount of bias, with true cross-loadings of 0.5 ($\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\Psi}_{1,2}}$ = 0.15), almost indistinguishable form the bias with cross-loadings of 0.2 ($\bar{Bias}_{\bar{\Psi}_{1,2}}$ = 0.11). The factor correlation was slightly over-estimated, for instance under true cross-loadings of 0.5 $\bar{\Psi}_{1,2} = 0.64$. Hereby, not noticeable differences between different sample sizes and sizes of the true cross-loadings arose.

Also regarding the bias in the estimates of the residual variances $\bar{\theta}_{1-6}$, the pattern of the RHSP was indistinguishable from that of the SVNP with $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. 

### Power and Type-I-Error Rate: SVNP

The top left panel of Figure 4 summarizes the Mean^[We present the Mean Power, averaged over the two truly non-zero cross-loadings, as separating cross-loadings leads to identical conclusions.] Power (true-positive rate) in selecting the truly two non-zero cross-loadings as non-zero of the SVNP, per set of conditions and selection criterion. The horizontal red dash line indicates the recommended minimum power of .80 suggested by @muthen_bayesian_2012.  

With a threshold of 0.00 there is a perfect power of 1 in selecting non-zero cross loadings. This is logical, since in Bayesian inference posterior means will never be entirely zero [@zhang_criteria_2021]. This result mostly serves to illustrate this property of Bayesian inference and thereby the need for more complex selection rules in Bayesian regularization, if the goal is variable selection itself, and not only unbiased model parameter estimates. 

Next, we can see that across most conditions, the Power falls under the desired threshold of 0.8. When $\sigma^2 = 0.001$ non-zero cross-loadings were always over-shrunken so much that they were never selected as non-zero. Under $\sigma^2 = 0.01$, the situation improved somewhat, with now cross-loadings of 0.5 being correctly selected as non zero for all selecting rules when N = 200. For N = 100, thresholds of 0.05. and 50% credible intervals also had the desired levels of power, with thresholds of 0.10 also almost reaching a power of .80. The SVNP performed best in terms of power when $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. With N = 200, all selection rules except for the 95% credible intervals reached the desired Power. With N = 100, all selection rules except for the 95% and 90% credible intervals exceeded a power of 0.80. 

The top right panel of Figure 4 summarizes the Mean Type-I-Error rate of the SVNP. As with the Power there is a Type-I-Error rate of 1 with the tresholding rule of 0.00, as posterior means are never entirely zero. In general, under most configurations the

# Conclusions and Discussion

This was the first study to apply the Regularized Horseshoe Prior (RHSP) in Bayesian Regularized SEM, by using it to select cross-loadings in CFA. A comparison to the classic Bayesian CFA.... 


The SVNP performs well when the truly non-zero cross-loadings are small, in terms of estimating the model without substantial bias. This can be interpreted as a successful instance of regularization, where an acceptable amount of bias is added to the model by shrinking some parameters to zero, to reach a more sparse solution. However, with larger truly non-zero cross-loadings, the performance of the SVNP decreases. With smaller values of $\sigma^2$, particularly with $\sigma^2 = 0.001$, these cross-loadings are still shrunken to zero, even though they are much larger in practice. This causes substantial bias in some main-loadings, and in the factor correlation. In practice, bias in structural parameters is particularly concerning, as it may lead to wrong conclusions in research on structural relationships between latent constructs. 

Bias occurs much less when $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. Such relatively large variance still allows for enough deviations from zero in the cross-loadings to yield relatively accurate estimates of the non-zero cross-loadings itself and consequently the other model parameters. However, simply using larger values of $\sigma^2$ is no general solution. In practice, models may include more structural parameters, even more cross-loadings, or a number of residual co-variances. Under these circumstances, large values of $\sigma^2$ may lead to identification issues. Moreover, the larger $\sigma^2$, the more cross-loadings will be selected as non-zero, which may ultimately lead to over-fitting. 


Future Research:

- More factors
- Residual Co-variances
- Binary, ordinal, nominal outcomes
- Larger sample sizes
- Invite reader to do this based on my code.
